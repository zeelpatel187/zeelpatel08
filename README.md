#Description of the code used in python file
In the very first step, I imported libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot
Then I imported dataset youtube.csv file and I ensured that the dataset has imported properly into the python. Then I created a function inside which I called the csv file.
I extracted first 10000 rows from the dataset.
I got a bar graph between channel count and channel type as shown the python file.
Nextly, I called csv file into a function.
In the last step, I printed the new csv file.
